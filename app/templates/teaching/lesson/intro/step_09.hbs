<p>Let's try working out the sets for this graph. Remember the equation for \(\text{In}(n)\):</p>

<p>\[\text{In}(n) = \bigcup_{p \in preds} \text{Out}(p)\]</p>

<p>This means, "take the union of \(\text{Out}(p)\) for all predecessors \(p\) of \(n\)". There are no predecessors for \(n_0\):</p>

<p>
    \begin{align}
    \text{In}(n_0) &= \bigcup_{p \in \emptyset} \text{Out}(p) \\
                   &= \emptyset \\
    \end{align}
</p>

<p>So the answer is the <strong>empty set</strong> (written \(\emptyset\) or \(\{\}\)).</p>
