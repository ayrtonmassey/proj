<p>We can represent our {{#definition "partial_order"}}partially ordered set{{/definition}} using a {{#definition "hasse_diagram"}}hasse diagram{{/definition}}. The nodes of the diagram represent elements of our set. The edges are pointed downward, and represent the \(\ge\) relationship - that is, a downward edge exists from \(x\) to \(y\) if \(x \ge y\). Looking at the graph on the right, although \( \small{\{ {\tt ra_1}, {\tt rc_1}, {\tt ra_2} \} \le \{ {\tt ra}_1 \}} \) we omit the edge because it is represented by the path through \( \small{\{ {\tt ra_1}, {\tt rc_1} \}} \).</p>
