<p class="lesson-generic-description">We call the <strong>combination</strong> of value sets the <strong>meet</strong> of those sets. In {{#definition "reaching_definitions"}}reaching definitions{{/definition}} we calculate the meet as the {{#definition "union"}}union{{/definition}} (denoted \(\bigcup\)) of sets. In some data-flow frameworks the meet can be a different set operation, such as the {{#definition "intersection"}}intersection{{/definition}} (denoted \(\bigcap\)).</p>
