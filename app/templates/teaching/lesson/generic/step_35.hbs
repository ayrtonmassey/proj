<p>Now, you might intutively think this diagram is wrong - surely sets with more elements are <strong>bigger</strong> than ones with fewer? However, for reaching definitions, this is <strong>incorrect</strong>! If you look at the definition of \(\le\), if \(x \land y = x\) then \(x\) is smaller than \(y\). Our meet operator here is \(\cup\), so if \(x \cup y = x\), then \(x\) is actually <strong>smaller</strong>!</p>
