<p>So how do we apply this to {{#definition "reaching_definition"}}reaching definitions{{/definition}}? We need to define a {{#definition "partial_order"}}partial order{{/definition}} on our values in terms of our {{#definition "meet_function"}}meet function{{/definition}}, \(\land\): \[ x \le y \iff x \land y = x \] That is, for <strong>some</strong> pairs of elements \(x\) and \(y\), the element \(x\) comes before \(y\) if \(x \land y\) is the same as \(x\). Note that <strong>not all</strong> elements need to be related in this way - we'll come to this in a minute.</p>
