<p class="lesson-generic-description">Previously, we have seen the {{#definition "transfer_function"}}transfer function{{/definition}} defined as \(\text{Out}(n)\). In generic frameworks we define a <strong>set</strong> of transfer functions, one for <strong>each node</strong> or <strong>block</strong> of code. We will see why this is important later on. For {{#definition "reaching_definitions"}}reaching definitions{{/definition}}, the transfer function is the <strong>same</strong> for every node.</p>
