<p>{{#definition "postorder"}}Post-order{{/definition}} is an {{#definition "ordering"}}ordering{{/definition}} of nodes in a graph or tree. Starting at the entry node, we visit <strong>each child</strong>, then each child's child, and so on. When we reach a node with <strong>no children</strong> we <strong>add</strong> it to the list, then add its <strong>parent</strong> to the list, and its parent and so on until we have an ordering in which we visit each node's <strong>children first</strong>. The <strong>post-ordering</strong> of our CFG is \([{\tt n_4}, {\tt n_3}, {\tt n_2}, {\tt n_1}, {\tt n_0} ]\).</p>
