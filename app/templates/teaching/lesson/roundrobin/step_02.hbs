<p>One way of calculating value sets is to take the {{#definition "round_robin"}}round robin approach{{/definition}}. You may remember from last time that we need to <strong>iterate</strong> our analysis until our values <strong>stop changing</strong>. Using the round-robin analysis algorithm, we evaluate nodes in a <strong>specific order</strong>, repeating this order in <strong>rounds</strong> until the values stop changing between rounds.</p>
