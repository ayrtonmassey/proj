It should not take a lot of time to test it and I hope it will actually be very useful, so will appreciate if you give it a go :)

Also, I was writing down notes as I tested the whole website. Not sure if all of them are useful, but will copy them here anyway:

After getting to the main page, there's no obvious indicator of what I should do next. I opted to just click on the first button in the list (in the middle of the page)
Introduction page looks useful, although since I don't take the course, didn't really go through all of it trying to learn a new language. Since it's more like a reference sheet, I might put it at the end of this list.

Weird that it's impossible to press 'back' to navigate the website. 

It's weird that in simulator, the form of the graph changes by moving the rectangles around. Might be easier to look at if the in/out values appeared inbetween the rectangles without moving them

I enjoyed the lessons!

The hover over explanations were nice, although I did not notice them at the start. Might be good to explicitly state you have them.

At one point early during lessons, it felt as if 'killing' of variables was not very clearly explained

I like how upon giving a correct answer, it is still explained! When giving answers in first lesson, I was still not 100% sure about them, so having them explained even when I was correct was nice.

Might be good to have links to specific parts of each lesson in case student wants to refresh knowledge of that step. Links to every step would be an overkill, of course, but just a very broad structure and links to start of 'topics' (e.g. round robin, post order) might be nice.

Weird that when test ends, there's still a 'next' button that can't be clicked"
